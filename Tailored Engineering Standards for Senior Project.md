# 6.4.2 Stakeholder Needs and Requirements Definition

## 1. Prepare for Stakeholder Needs and Requirements Definition

### a. Identify the stakeholders who have an interest in the software system throughout its lifecycle

This corresponds to outcome a), which is "Stakeholders of the system are identified." The XP implementation of this task is Real Customer Involvement, since making "people whose lives and business are affected by your system part of the team" is integral to making the software that the stakeholders want.

### b. Define the stakeholder needs and requirements definition strategy

This corresponds to outcome d), which is "Stakeholders needs are defined." The XP implementation of this task is Stories, as they encourage engineers to "plan using units of customer-visible functionality". This allows us to identify the needs of the stakeholders quickly.

### c. Identify and plan for the necessary enabling systems for services needed to support stakeholder needs and requirements definition

This corresponds to outcome g), which is "Stakeholder agreement that their needs and expectations are reflected adequately in the requirements achieved." The XP implementation of this task is also in Stories, as "estimation gives the business and technical perspective a chance to interact", where stories are a good vehicle for this indetification.

### d. Attain or acquire access to the enabling systems or services to be used

This corresponds to outcome h), which is "Any enabling systems or services needed for stakeholder needs and requirements are available". The XP implementation of this task is Stories, specifically when engineers "write the stories on index cards and put them on a frequently-passed wall". That way, getting access to these stories is easy.

## 2. Define Stakeholder Needs

### a. Define context of use within the concept of operations and the preliminary life cycle concepts

This corresponds to outcome b), which is "Required characteristics and context of use of capabilities and concepts in the life cycle stages, including the operational concepts, are defined." The XP implementation of this task is...

### b. Identify Stakeholder Needs

This corresponds to outcome d), which is "Stakeholders needs are defined." The XP implementation of this task is...

### c. Prioritize and down-select needs

This corresponds to outcome ), which is "Stakeholders needs are defined." The XP implementation of this task is

# 6.4.4 Architecture Definition Process

## 1. Prepare for Architecture Definition.

### a. Review pertinent information and identify key drivers of the architecture.

This corresponds to outcome c), which is "Context, boundaries, and external interfaces of the system are defined." The XP implementation of this task is Stories, since once the information and key drivers are identified, teams will want to put them on stories for convenience.

### b. Identify stakeholder concerns.

This corresponds to outcome a), which is "Identified stakeholder concerns are addressed by this architecture." The XP implementation of this task is Real Customer Involvement; learning the concerns of the stakeholder is much easier if they are a part of the process.

### d. Define architecture evaluation criteria based on stakeholder concerns and key requirements.

This corresponds to outcome k), which is "Traceability of architecture elements to stakeholder and system/software requirements is developed." The XP implementation of this task is also Real Customer Involvement, since those concerns and requirements can only be identified if the customer is involved in the process.

### e. Identify and plan for the necessary enabling systems or services needed to support the Architecture Definition process.

This corresponds to outcome j), which is "Any enabling systems or services needed for architecture definition are available." The XP implementation of this task is Negotiated Scope Contract, as this is the part of the Architecture Definition process where scope is being established.

## 2. Develop architecture viewpoints.

### a. Select, adapt, or develop viewpoints and model kinds based on stakeholder concerns.

This corresponds to outcome b), which is "Architecture viewpoints are developed." The XP implementation of this task is Real Customer Involvement. If we need the stakeholder, they need to get involved.

### b. Establish or identify potential architecture framework(s) to be used in developing models and views.

This corresponds to outcome d), which is "Architecture views and models of the system are developed." The XP implementation of this task is Negotiated Scope Contract; exactly what will be developed is a part of defining the scope.

## 3. Develop models and views of candidate architectures.

### a. Define the software system context and boundaries in terms of interfaces and interactions with external entities.

This corresponds to outcome f), which is "System elements and their interfaces are identified." The XP implementation of this task is Pair Programming, as with collaboration, defining the system and its boundaries will be more consistent throughout the team.

### b. Identify architectural entities and relationships between entities that address key stakeholder concerns and critical software system requirements.

This corresponds to outcome i), which is "Alignment of the architecture with requirements and design characteristics is achieved." The XP implementation of this task is Incremental Design, which will evolve the architecture and its relationships slowly, to ensure that the progress is productive.

### c. Allocate concepts, properties, characteristics, behaviors, functions, or constraints that are significant to architecture decisions of the software system to architectural entities.

This corresponds to outcome e), which is "Concepts, properties, characteristics, behaviors, functions, or constraints that are significant to architecture decisions of the system are allocated to architectural entities." The XP implementation of this task is Test-First Programming, which will allow all of these to be incremented into the system, and be modified based on feedback.

### d. Select, adapt, or develop models of the candidate architectures of the software system.

This corresponds to outcome g), which is "Architecture candidates are assessed." The XP implementation of this task is Code and Tests, as this will let the candidate architectures be as concise as possible, not cluttering up the code with unnecessary artifacts, and let anything wasteful be cleared out easily.

## 4. Relate the architecture to design.

### a. Identify software system elements that relate to architectural entities and the nature of these relationships.

This corresponds to outcome f) because it relates to identifying system elements. This relates to the extreme programming practice of incremental design: “If small, safe steps are how to design, the next question is where in the system to improve the design.” It is necessary to consider where in the system relates to the architectural design.

### b. Define the interfaces and interactions among the software system elements and external entities.

This corresponds to outcome f) because it talks about system elements and their interfaces. 
In extreme programming, you do this every day as part of incremental design: “Invest in the design of the system every day.” As part of this, you need to understand the interactions between system elements.

### c. Partition, align and allocate requirements to architectural entities and system elements.

This corresponds to outcome k) because it connects requirements to the architectural entities. In extreme programming, this is implemented as part of weekly cycles: “Break the stories into tasks. Team members sign up for tasks and estimate them.” You partition the requirements and allocate them to system elements.

### d. Map software system elements and architectural entities to design characteristics.

This corresponds to outcome i) because it aligns architecture with design. This is implemented in extreme programming as part of incremental design. “Refactoring is a discipline of design that codifies these recurring patterns of changes.” By refactoring, you map recurring changes, which are the design characteristics.

### e. Define principles for the software system design and evolution.

This corresponds to outcome h) because it relates to the evolution or life cycle of the system. This is implemented in extreme programming through incremental design: “XP teams are confident in their ability to adapt the design to future requirements.” As the system evolves, new principles are designed and defined.
