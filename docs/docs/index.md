# Welcome to GLADOS

GLADOS is an Automated Science Pipeline, allowing for computational research experiments to get aggregated results from multiple experiment runs easily. Currently developed by seniors at Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology, the goal is to develop a system that makes it simple to run experiments and gather relevant data, through a low cost, open-source, community-built project.

When you're on the Rose-Hulman internal network, you can access the deployed project at <https://glados.csse.rose-hulman.edu>.

## Usage

**To run an experiment on a running copy of the system**, [get started here](tutorial/usage.md).


## Development

To set up a new machine for development, follow the [developer installation guide](../docs/developerhelp/setup.md).

To get familiar with the components of the system, check out the [Best Practices](../docs/tutorial/best_practices.md).
