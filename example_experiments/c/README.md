# AddNum C Example

This experiment demonstrates C support.

Exact same setup as Python's AddNumsForConfig.py but set up for C.
For an example on how to use `ini.h`, refer to `add_nums.c`.

### Compiling
This example can be compiled within Unix systems (or WSL if your system is Windows) as follows:
```
gcc add_nums.c include/ini.c -o add_nums
```
The system currently does not support C projects compiled for Windows.

### Settings
Example settings for a run that demonstrates this:

Parameters:
x, 1, 1, 10, 1
y, 1, 1, 10, 1
