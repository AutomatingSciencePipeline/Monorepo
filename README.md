# Automating Science Pipeline

The Automating Science Pipeline seeks to make it easier to run data-collecting computer simulations by allowing easy access to a distributed network of experiment runners.

- The system is designed to be easier to use than implementing a solution yourself. No knowledge of containers or distributed systems required.
- A user should be able to download and simulate the system on their local machine with minimal effort and configuration.
- The system is open source and designed for expansion to other languages and user-implemented functionality (ex. Output data post-processing).

## User Guide

This user guide is meant to assist first time users in setting up a local simulation of the system. You can find it on the [wiki](https://github.com/AutomatingSciencePipeline/Monorepo/wiki/User-Guide).

## Running an Experiment

Directions for running an experiment (on a local simulated system or the live system) can be found [on the wiki](https://github.com/AutomatingSciencePipeline/Monorepo/wiki/Running-An-Experiment).
